It teaches a lesson that we can all learn from. If you haven't seen this classic already, I highly recommend it :)\r\n\r\nIn other news, I'll be at Anime Expo this year at tables A/B 37 and 38 with books, posters, and more! See you there! :D",

I have always loved all imagery of Sherlock Holmes playing the violin, I find it very striking and it's one of his most recognizable and interesting character traits. This piece is inspired by BBC's Sherlock (I cannot possibly recommend this show more!) \r\n\r\nTime-lapsed process video can be watched here. Drawn and painted in Adobe Photoshop with a Wacom tablet. Reference from here.\r\n\r\nAvailable to buy as a phone case and other products here.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT 10/09/13: I have provided this high-res wallpaper as a COURTESY to fellow Sherlock fans, and I expect my work to be treated with respect. Time and time again I have seen art thieves download this painting, PHOTOSHOP OUT MY SIGNATURE, and re-upload it to their own websites as a \"free wallpaper,\" or, even worse, print it as a poster or on a phone case to sell on eBay, Amazon, Etsy, StoreEnvy, etc. It's absolutely ridiculous and disappointing. I'm leaving the wallpaper up because I know most don't do that, but I'm going to say this once again since it's apparently not clear: DO NOT REMOVE MY SIGNATURE FROM THIS ARTWORK FOR ANY REASON . If you see this painting on any of the above sites, please do me a favor and report it. If you see this painting on any products or websites without credit to me, I ask you not to buy it, and JUST REPORT IT. Thank you.\r\n",

Colours slightly modified on the PC (as the skanner already tried to eat the colours up anyway, might as well try make it a bit more vivid than the original paper-version).\r\n\r\nThis is a D&D style sapphire dragon, one of the neutral gem dragons species.\r\n\r\nSapphires are slender, or some say very thin, in build compared to other dragons. They are more dexterous as well, albeit less strong considering muscle-power than some other dragon type of their age.\r\nSapphire dragons could be considered anti-social as well as quite territorial - they rather live alone in solitude, rarely seeking out any of their own kind even, preferring their vast underground lairs in the Underdark or sometimes on the Elemental Plane of Earth. They do consider the evil denizens of their region as enemies, though, directly confronting them if they threaten the dragon's own grounds.\r\nAs masters of military strategy, they enjoy strategic games and favor discussions over tactics than any small talk - known to forgive intrusions, even, if the visitor offers a game of such type (of course letting the dragon lose is not too wise).\r\nA sapphire dragon's scales do not change colour throughout its lifetime, but are rather one shade of twinkling blue; ranging from night-dark to light blue in hue. The scales reflect any source of light, creating many tiny scintillating glints on the walls of caverns.",

The sheets are made of lovely watercolour and acrylic painting paper. It's one of my favourites, hence I chose it for this book. It took me a while to figure out how to fix the eye underneath and around the the leather. It's sealed like a bombshell and would never come off.\r\n\r\nThis one will be for display and auction at the Eurofurence artshow. Thank you so much for looking <3",

When the lower jaw opens to facilitate drinking, smoking, or speaking, the fangs are revealed which previously appeared to be part of the lips. The fangs also function as clasps that hold the hatch closed.\r\n\r\nThe design is inspired by samurai armour masks and Venetian Carnival masks with a steampunk aesthetic.\r\n\r\nI sculpted onto a plaster cast of my face in Roma Plastilina, molded it in rubber, cast it in wax, and then dipped the wax in a silica slurry shell mold. I then cut open the bottom of the shell mold and fired it in a furnace, to first melt out the wax, and then to fire it into a ceramic like density which is very resistant to extremely high temperatures. My foundry class then filled the mold with molten bronze (a task which takes a team of many people). Then once it cooled down, I set to work smashing off the shell with a hammer and chisel and sawing off the gates which allow the bronze to flow into the mold. Then I sand blasted it and cleaned it up further using a bench grinder and a dremel tool. After that, I polished the surface with a variety of sand papers and steel wool to achieve a smooth surface. Next I drilled and tapped the holes for the bolts to secure the straps and hinges. Then I applied the patina, which involved heating the mask with a propane torch, then spraying on the liver of sulfur in layers, applying the torch until it was a solid black. I then buffed the highlights back out with a scotch rite pad and steel wool.\r\n\r\nThe project took me three months to finish, though admittedly I was working on 8 other projects at the same time.",
